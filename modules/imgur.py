"""
Since imgur wants you to create user account to access read-only api which also required to give your email and phone number,
I went with direct json request method. You can extract album id from album link and pass it to hit.json.
This gives you json file with information about album that also contains hashes aka image links and their type.
It is enough to download one json file and extract+reconstruct links to all album images.
