# lil ripper

A multiprocess-python program for subreddit archiving purposes. It will try to extract all media links from subreddit posts and download them. It uses [pushshift](https://pushshift.io/) to generate `json` links containing Reddit post data. **Generating links will take a while, to not spam pushshift with API calls.** Be patient.



## Features

:clown_face:Does not download already downloaded files if same directory is given.

:ghost:Downloading is distributed between multiple processes. 

:alien: Downloading introduces a delay between 1 and 5 seconds for normal links and additional delay for `gfycat` links, to not get your `ip` blacklisted. *Happens almost instantly if you are not using good headers and spamming them with requests. Be gentle.*

:sunglasses: Only tested on GNU/Linux systems.




## Supported download links
- [x] direct link ending in valid format given by user
- [x] i.reddit
