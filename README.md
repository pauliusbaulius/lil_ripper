# lil ripper <a name="project">

Lil ripper is a media archival tool for subreddits/chan threads. It downloads images and video files from given subreddit(s) by extracting all urls from posts. It uses [pushshift](https://pushshift.io/) to generate json links containing Reddit post data, which includes urls. **Generating links will take a while, to not spam pushshift with API calls.** Be patient, program is not frozen. If you are trying to archive a big subreddit, there might be a few thousand of urls that have to be parsed. Chan threads are downloaded without having to generate anything.

**This project requires `ffmpeg` to download v.reddit videos**, since they are made out of two parts. One file is video without sound, another is just sound. `ffmpeg` is used to join both files together and create one `.webm`. 

Since this project does not eploy proxies, you may encounter trouble with subreddits that contain a lot of gfycat links. Gfycat does not like people scrapping their website and will blacklist your IP for several hours, if you make a lot of requests. This is a problem I am trying to solve in next updates.



**! WORKS ON LINUX ONLY !** Since I haven't tested it on other systems, I made it Linux only. This might change in the future, when I will get access to a Windows machine and/or a Mac.

Some examples:

```python
# Download all possible media from r/dankmemes from posts with >=10.000 upvotes to Downloads directory. It will create a folder "dankmemes".
python3 -m lilripper -r dankmemes -u 10000 -d /home/boolean/Downloads

# Download all possible media from r/dankmemes and r/memes with >=1.00 upvotes to Download directory. Will create directories for each subreddit.
python3 -m lilripper -r dankmemes memes -u 1000 -d /home/boolean/Downloads

# Download all media from a thread in /g/.
python3 -m lilripper -c https://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/51971506/the-g-wiki -d /home/boolean/Downloads
    
# Download all webms from a subreddit.
python3 -m lilripper -r idiotsincars -f webm -d /home/boolean/Downloads
```



### Developers <a name="developers">

#TODO information how to build the package, run tests and create venv.



## Roadmap <a name="roadmap">

- [x] fix -f flag, since it does not work at all anymore.
- [x] 4chan thread media archiving, under -c flag.
- [x] add pytest tests WIP
- [ ] show status how long it took to generate links and download each file. maybe a progress bar?
  - [x] download time
  - [ ] generation time
- [ ] maybe add image/video compression option to reduce size of media on disk in exchange for cpu usage and electricity?
- [ ] skip v.reddit videos if user has no ffmpeg, check for it first. This would allow the program to work on Windows with no shell access.



## Changelog <a name="changelog">

[0.0.8]

- -l is added. Lil ripper will make logs as of this version.



[0.0.7] 

- You can now download 4chan threads with -c flag.
- -f flag is working as intended.
